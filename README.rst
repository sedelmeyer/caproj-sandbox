NYC Capital Projects
===============================

This project is an exploratory analysis experimenting with different approaches to modeling and feature engineering to predict outcomes for New York City managed capital projects with budgets greater than $25 million, using an openly available `data set hosted by NYC Open Data`_.

Summary
-------

This analysis replicates and builds from one initially completed as a final project for `CS109B Advanced Topics In Data Science`_, a course offered by Harvard University's John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS). The authors of that original project are:

- `An Hoang <https://github.com/hoangthienan95>`_
- `Mark McDonald <https://github.com/mcdomx>`_
- `Mike Sedelmeyer <https://github.com/sedelmeyer>`_

The original project, on which this one is based, can be found on GitHub at: https://github.com/mcdomx/cs109b_groupproject. The final report summarizing the methods and findings for that project can be found in the `Jupyter Notebook-based final report for that project <https://github.com/mcdomx/cs109b_groupproject/blob/master/notebooks/Module-E-final-report-Group71.ipynb>`_.
