An investigation into feature engineering and modeling project-change data for large-scale capital projects.

.. Note::

   **This project is primarily being constructed for my own personal learning experience, where my current area of focus are approaches to generating tested and log-generating data pipelines. As such:**

   * Please disregard existing project releases, because they do not adhere to semantic versioning standards.

     * There is a chance that I may stabilize future releases, but that will be entirely dependent on how long I continue to work on this repository.

   * Please also disregard existing project documentation, which is currently not a focus of my current efforts.
